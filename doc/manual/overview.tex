\chapter*{Overview}

This manual documents \libadjoint, a library whose aim is \emph{to make
writing discrete adjoint models as easy as possible}. The library assists
developing adjoint models for both steady and time-dependent problems,
in serial or parallel. It is explicitly designed to be orthogonal to the
discretisation employed, and to be bolted-on to an existing discrete model.
