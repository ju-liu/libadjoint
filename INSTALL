If you are using Ubuntu, installing libadjoint is as easy as:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:libadjoint/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libadjoint libadjoint-dev python-libadjoint

Compiling libadjoint
====================

If you would like to configure and compile libadjoint yourself, you have two
possibilities. Using CMake is recommended.

Using CMake
-----------

Create a separate build directory next to the libadjoint source and run CMake
in it:

$ ls
libadjoint
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

All typical CMake commands are available. For example to set the compiler,
specify the installation directory, and build a shared library, you would
execute

$ CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx FC=mpif90 cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/custom/install/path \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=TRUE \
    ../source

After the CMake configuration, type

$ make
$ make install

in the build directory to build and install libadjoint.

Note: to use the generalised stability analysis features of libadjoint,
you need to compile against PETSc and SLEPc. This can be done in the
usual way (set PETSC_ARCH, PETSC_DIR, and SLEPC_DIR appropriately).
