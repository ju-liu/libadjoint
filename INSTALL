If you are using Ubuntu, installing libadjoint is as easy as:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:libadjoint/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libadjoint libadjoint-dev python-libadjoint

The minimum requirements for compiling libadjoint are a C compiler 
(environment variable CC) and a C++ compiler (environment variable
CXX). If these are not specified, the defaults are 'mpicc' and 'mpicxx'.
With these, the library may be built and installed with a simple

make install prefix=/install/path

To compile the Fortran bindings, a modern Fortran compiler is required;
the Fortran bindings employ the F2003 iso_c_binding construct, for which
support is still shaky. Versions of gfortran >= 4.5 are known to work.
The environment variable for the Fortran compiler is FC; the default
is 'mpif90'. If a working Fortran compiler is available, the Fortran bindings
will be built and installed automatically.

To compile the Python bindings, gccxml (http://www.gccxml.org; Ubuntu package
gccxml) is required. If gccxml is available, the Python bindings will be
built and installed automatically.
