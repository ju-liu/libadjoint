Description: Library for adjointing computational models
 Libadjoint is a library for adjointing computational models. It aims to
 make adjointing models easy (or rather, as easy as possible). Its fundamental
 abstraction is that a model is a sequence of linear solves.
 .
 It provides an API by which the model developer may build a "tape" of
 what the model does, in terms of the linear solves that it executes.
 This tape may then be "rewound" by libadjoint to compute the adjoint
 equation associated with every forward linear solve. It may also
 be "replayed", to compare the genuine forward model output against
 libadjoint's interpretation of the forward model.
